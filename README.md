Description: In a traditional  voting system, voting is a very financially consuming process, the expenses incurred range from personnel recruitment, printing of ballot papers, buying of ballot boxes etc. Despite all of these, there is no guarantee of a credible, accurate and transparent result.
 
 
Overview and purpose of the system: This application is a voting smart contract, designed to solve most of the issues of the traditional voting system, such as result falsification, duplicate entry of values.


System content (system boundaries): This smart contract was written in Solidity version --pragma solidity >=0.6. 0 <0.8. 0;


Interaction (potential) of the product (with other products and components): The smart contract can be interacted with using javascript and front end libraries like React.


Product features: Terms of reference, Implementation of Keypair and Signature classes, Implementation of Hash,Block, and Blockchainclasses.


Security requirements: The code must be further optimized before deployed in to production


Characteristics of users: Organizations that intend to carry out a voting process


Restrictions: This is just a sample of concept and as not necessarily been optimized.
